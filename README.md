# WormGame

*wormgame2.py* is the original version of the game...keyboard based.

*wormgame_gamepad.py* uses the generic keypad controller to move the worm, and adds high score functionality.  Game now loops forever (or until ctl-c is pressed)

*usb_gamepad.py* is the driver module for the gamepad.  Uses the evdev package.
